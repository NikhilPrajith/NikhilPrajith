### About me
I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at City College of New York, following the path step by step to gain a strong understanding of general software engineering and Machine Learning. I have done a few internships at organizations that create innovative tools and ideas used to solve challenging problems.

I frequently enjoy studying new programming frameworks and developments, especially in the artificial intelligence field, and loving the scalability power of tech. 
Outside of programming and professional development, I like to play soccer; please don't ask Messi or Ronaldo, and I also watch shows to learn about new cultures. 

Happy to talk more!
